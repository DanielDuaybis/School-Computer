My Favorite Meal

	My favorite meal is brunch. This is beacuse combines two meals that both contain very yummy food items. The two
meals that brunch combines are: breakfast and lunch. Breakfast is an incredible meal as you can have both sweet and savory
foods. Items such as pancakes, waffles, and muffins can make a tasty breakfast seem like dessert! Savory foods of
breakfast are bacon, sausage, eggs, and potatoes. The hearty combination of these two flavors in one meal is truly
stunning! Lunch also adds to the greatness of brunch because you can put sandwiches, burgers, pizza, fries, and even
steak with your breakfast. The combination of these two types of foods is truly what makes brunch incredible. The best way
to enjoy brunch however, is with a buffet. Using a buffet to choose your favorite foods out of such a vast selection
can lead to fusions of food never tried before, and the all-you-can-eat part of a buffet is always the best. In conclusion,
brunch is the best meal of the day as it combines a vast variety of all flavors of food into one giant meal.
